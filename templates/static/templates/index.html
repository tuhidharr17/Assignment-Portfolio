                I designed and developed a fully functional e-commerce website
                using Flask, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The platform allows users
                to browse through a variety of products, add items to their
                cart, and securely complete transactions using payment gateways
                like Stripe or PayPal. I implemented user authentication and
                authorization features for secure account management and ensured
                the website's responsiveness across different devices.
                Additionally, I integrated robust web security measures to
                protect user data and transactions.

                As part of my portfolio, I created a feature-rich blogging
                platform using Flask and associated technologies. Users can
                register, create, edit, and delete blog posts with ease. The
                platform supports Markdown for post formatting and features a
                user-friendly interface for seamless content creation. I
                implemented advanced features such as comment sections, post
                categorization, and search functionality to enhance user
                engagement and experience. Moreover, I optimized the platform
                for search engines and social media sharing to maximize content
                visibility and reach.

                I developed a comprehensive task management application

                allows users to organize their tasks efficiently, set deadlines,
                and prioritize work seamlessly. Leveraging CRUD operations and
                real-time updates, users can manage tasks effortlessly while
                collaborating with team members. The application features
                intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces for task prioritization and
                integrates notifications for upcoming deadlines to ensure timely
                completion of tasks. Additionally, I designed RESTful APIs for
                seamless integration with external services, enhancing the
                application's functionality and versatility.

              Embarking on the journey to Morgan House in Kalimpong, each twist
              and turn of the road felt like an adventure unfolding. Surrounded
              by the lush greenery of the hills, excitement bubbled within as we
              approached our destination. Upon reaching Morgan House, a sense of
              awe swept over me at the sight of its regal charm. Stepping
              inside, the cozy atmosphere welcomed me with open arms, as if
              inviting me to become a part of its history. Through the windows,
              the majestic Himalayan peaks greeted me, stirring a sense of
              wonder and tranquility. In that moment, I felt connected to both
              the past and the natural beauty surrounding me, creating memories
              to cherish forever.
